#### Can I use Morph-KGC in a commercial project?
Yes!

Of course, we will appreciate it if you tell us that you are using Morph-KGC and can give us some details on how it is being used (as much as you can given confidentiality constraints). This would allow creating a database of projects where Morph-KGC is being used that could help us to request additional funding in the future, if needed.
